This directory contains scripts and code needed to identify and label the 
leader-genome/subgenome splice sites in RNA reads in fastq files.  It is designed to run
on UCSF's wynton cluster.

Simple how to: 

1) Copy this whole directory to your home or other working directory on wynton (git clone, scp, etc...)
2) cd to the copy of this directory
3) run: bash setup.sh  [path to fastq files]
4) edit two files generated above as instructed
5) submit two jobs as instructed

Done!
